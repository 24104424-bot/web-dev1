       Hi! I’m John Rene P. Panugan, and my Ultimate Frisbee journey began in 2020 during the pandemic at a beach in my hometown. My friends convinced me to play, and from that day, I fell in love with the sport.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
       My Frisbee journey grew even more when I came to Cebu to study at the University of San Carlos (USC). I started playing anywhere I could — in fields, parks, and open spaces — and met so many amazing people who share the same love for Ultimate. Cebu became special to me, not just because of my studies, but because it’s where I grew both as a player and as a person.
