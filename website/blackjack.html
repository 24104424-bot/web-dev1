<p style="color: #9ca3af; font-size: 18px;">The classic card game of skill and strategy</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. It's a game that combines luck with strategy, making it one of the most popular casino games worldwide.</p>
<p>You're not competing against other players‚Äîonly against the dealer. This makes it an exciting one-on-one challenge.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Card Values</h2>
<ul>
<li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value</li>
<li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 10 points</li>
<li>Aces can be worth either 1 or 11‚Äîyour choice based on what helps your hand</li>
<li>A hand with an Ace valued as 11 is called a "soft" hand</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Game Play</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each player receives two cards face up; dealer gets one up, one down</li>
<li><strong>Hit:</strong> Request another card to improve your total</li>
<li><strong>Stand:</strong> Keep your current hand and end your turn</li>
<li><strong>Double Down:</strong> Double your bet and receive exactly one more card</li>
<li><strong>Split:</strong> If you have two cards of the same value, split them into two hands</li>
<li>If your total exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose immediately</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Winning Conditions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting</li>
<li>The dealer busts (goes over 21) while you don't</li>
<li>You get a "Blackjack" (Ace + 10/face card) which typically pays 3:2</li>
<li>If you and the dealer tie, it's a "push" and you get your bet back</li>
</ul>
</div>
