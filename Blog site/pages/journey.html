       It all started on a beach in my hometown during the pandemic. My friends convinced me to try throwing the disc, and from that moment, I was hooked. The sound of the disc cutting through the air and the fun we shared made me realize this was something special.

       Now, Ultimate Frisbee has become a big part of my life and identity. I’ve grown so much since that first throw at the beach. I’m now the team captain of my university team and have competed in tournaments outside Mindanao, representing not just my school but also the community that helped me grow. Through every game, I’ve gained confidence in my playing style, learned to lead others, and built lasting friendships along the way. Frisbee has truly shaped who I am today — both on and off the field.
