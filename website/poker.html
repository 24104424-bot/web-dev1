<p style="color: #9ca3af; font-size: 18px;">The ultimate game of skill, strategy, and psychology</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Poker is more than just a card game—it's a complex blend of mathematics, psychology, and strategy. The aim is to win chips by either having the best hand at showdown or convincing your opponents to fold their cards before then.</p>
<p>Unlike other casino games, in poker you're playing against other players, not the house. This makes it a unique test of skill where the best players consistently win over time.</p>

<h2>Hand Rankings (Highest to Lowest)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Royal Flush:</strong> A, K, Q, J, 10 all of the same suit—the ultimate unbeatable hand</li>
<li><strong>Straight Flush:</strong> Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9-8-7-6-5 of hearts)</li>
<li><strong>Four of a Kind:</strong> Four cards of the same rank (e.g., four Kings)</li>
<li><strong>Full House:</strong> Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., three 8s and two 4s)</li>
<li><strong>Flush:</strong> Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence</li>
<li><strong>Straight:</strong> Five consecutive cards of different suits</li>
<li><strong>Three of a Kind:</strong> Three cards of the same rank</li>
<li><strong>Two Pair:</strong> Two different pairs (e.g., two Jacks and two 7s)</li>
<li><strong>One Pair:</strong> Two cards of the same rank</li>
<li><strong>High Card:</strong> When you have none of the above, your highest card plays</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Texas Hold'em Play</h2>
<p>Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant. Here's how a hand unfolds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Flop:</strong> Each player receives two private "hole" cards. First betting round begins</li>
<li><strong>The Flop:</strong> Three community cards are dealt face-up. Second betting round</li>
<li><strong>The Turn:</strong> A fourth community card is dealt. Third betting round</li>
<li><strong>The River:</strong> The fifth and final community card. Final betting round</li>
<li><strong>Showdown:</strong> Remaining players reveal their hands. Best five-card combination wins the pot</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Betting Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fold:</strong> Give up your hand and forfeit any chips already in the pot</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> Pass the action without betting (only if no one has bet yet)</li>
<li><strong>Call:</strong> Match the current bet to stay in the hand</li>
<li><strong>Raise:</strong> Increase the current bet, forcing others to call the higher amount</li>
<li><strong>All-In:</strong> Bet all your remaining chips</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Strategy Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Successful poker requires much more than just knowing the hand rankings. Position, pot odds, reading opponents, and bankroll management are all crucial skills.</p>
<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>Starting Tip:</strong> Play tight and aggressive. Focus on premium starting hands (high pairs, A-K, A-Q) especially when you're learning. Position matters—being last to act is a huge advantage.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="info-section">
<h2>Common Variants</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texas Hold'em:</strong> The most popular variant, played in major tournaments worldwide</li>
<li><strong>Omaha:</strong> Similar to Hold'em but players get four hole cards and must use exactly two</li>
<li><strong>Seven-Card Stud:</strong> No community cards; players build hands from their own seven cards</li>
<li><strong>Five-Card Draw:</strong> Classic poker where players can exchange cards to improve their hand</li>
</ul>
